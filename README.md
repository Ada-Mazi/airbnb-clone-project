## 🎨 Figma Design Specifications

All UI screens are designed using **Figma**. The design adheres to Airbnb’s visual principles — clean, minimal, and user-focused.

### 🎨 Color Palette

| **Color Name** | **Hex Code** | **Usage** |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Primary | `#FF5A5F` | Buttons, highlights, and key call-to-action elements |
| Secondary | `#008489` | Links, badges, secondary actions |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` | Page background |
| Text | `#222222` | Primary text |
| Secondary Text | `#717171` | Subtext, labels, descriptions |

### ✍️ Typography

| **Element** | **Font Family** | **Weight** | **Size** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary Font | Circular | Medium (500) | 16px |
| Headings | Circular | Bold (700) | 24px–32px |
| Secondary Text | Circular | Book (400) | 14px |

### 🧩 UI Style Guidelines

- Rounded corners for buttons and cards (8px–12px radius)  
- Consistent spacing (8px baseline grid)  
- Use shadow and contrast to establish hierarchy  
- Apply hover and focus states for interactive elements  
- Follow a **mobile-first responsive grid** (12-column desktop, 6-column mobile)

---

## 🧱 Wireframes and Mockups

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Define layout and structure of each page  
- **High-Fidelity Mockups:** Created in Figma with color, typography, and components  
- **Prototype:** Interactive flow for user testing before implementation

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

1. **Landing → Search → Filter → View Listing → Book → Confirm Booking**  
2. Designed to minimize friction, with clear calls to action at each step  
3. Visual and textual feedback for all user actions (loading, errors, confirmations)  

---

## 🧩 Design Review and Updates

- Conduct **design reviews** during each sprint  
- Gather **user feedback** through testing sessions
